One challenge that every side project has is attracting and engaging users. Whether your side project is an open source library, a software as a service, or a physical product, you need a way to quickly tell visitors about it and hook them into trying it. That's where a landing page comes in.

A good landing page helps visitors quickly determine whether or not your product is right for them, and if it is, the landing page should direct them to take an action. Depending on what it is you're promoting, your landing page might ask for an email signup, encourage a file download, or direct users to add something to their cart. Either way, you don't have to spend weeks coding your landing page from scratch. In fact, if you're a developer, I would encourage you to use a tool developed by marketers who know the best practices for landing pages rather than try to build your own.

Fortunately, there are many great and easy-to-use landing page generators and tools available. Some require a little knowledge of HTML and CSS, while others are completely non-tech friendly. Try a few of these tools out, and let me know which one you prefer.
