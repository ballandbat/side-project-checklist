Social media can be a time-consuming and mentally tasking chore. Many small business owners just skip social media, but after spending years posting consistently on my personal social media accounts, I can tell you that it can work and it doesn't take as much time as you think. Social media is a great way to drive traffic once you build a following, but for many small businesses, the question is, "how do you build a following?"

Step one is to **consistently post relevant content on social media**. It may take months or years to build up a significant following, but once you do, social media can be as powerful as an [email marketing list](http://localhost:4000/2017/email-marketing-tools/) for driving traffic to your blog, website, or side project. Not only will your followers see updates, most social networks have an amplification formula where popular public posts will be shared to an even broader audience. The only way to eventually make something go viral is to make sure people hear about it, and social media is a great place to start.

All that said, you don't want your social media channels to be boring, spammy, or annoying. You want them filled with regularly published, interesting, relevant, and fresh content. Now, this is where social media automation tools can help!
 
By automating your social media efforts, you can queue up posts for the month ahead, get suggestions for new stories to post, or keep an eye on what your fans or followers are saying. The tools below help with one or all of those things, so if you're getting started on social media, I highly recommend making your life easier by automating much of it.
