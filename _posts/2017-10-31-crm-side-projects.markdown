Customer Relationship Management (or CRM for short) software can help you manage customers, make more money, and keep up with leads, but it can also get expensive and cumbersome pretty quickly. While many side projects may not need a CRM tool (spreadheets often work when you have few customers), there are some good ones here that won't set you back too much.
